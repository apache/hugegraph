# props.awk — read and rewrite Java ".properties" files with the grammar
# HugeConfig (commons-configuration over JDK Properties) applies, so the
# entrypoint and the server agree on what a mounted file means.  grep/sed
# rewrites do not: they see `\`-escaped keys, `:` separators, continuation
# lines and duplicate definitions differently, which is how a mounted
# config ends up with two definitions of one key.
#
# One invocation, selected with the `PROPS_MODE` environment variable:
#
#   PROPS_MODE=get  PROPS_KEY=K PROPS_FILE=F
#       print the value of K's first logical definition, in the on-disk
#       escaped form; with PROPS_DECODED=1 print it as java.util.Properties
#       would hand it to the server.  Always exits 0.
#   PROPS_MODE=has  PROPS_KEY=K PROPS_FILE=F
#       print nothing; exit 0 when K has any definition at all, empty
#       included, 1 when it has none, 2 on an error
#   PROPS_MODE=set  PROPS_KEY=K PROPS_FILE=F
#       replace K's first definition in place, drop every other
#       definition of K, append one when the file has none.  The new
#       value arrives pre-encoded in PROPS_VALUE_ENCODED (an environment
#       variable, so secrets never appear in `ps` output or in awk's
#       argv), and -v is not used for it so awk cannot mangle its
#       backslash escapes.
#
# Grammar implemented (java.util.Properties line reader + the
# first-definition-wins rule Configuration.getString applies):
#   - physical lines end at \r\n, \n or a bare \r, as in java.util.Properties
#   - '#' / '!' comments and blank lines
#   - '=' / ':' / whitespace separators, where the whitespace Java counts is
#     space, tab and form feed, with whitespace then an optional single '=' or
#     ':' accepted as one separator
#   - continuations: a physical line ending in an odd number of
#     backslashes joins the next line (its leading whitespace stripped)
#   - backslash escapes in keys and values, including \uXXXX
#   - duplicate logical keys resolve to the first definition
#
# Rewrites keep every untouched line byte-for-byte (comments, blank
# lines, unrelated entries), and replace the first definition where it
# stands, so mounted configs stay reviewable in git diffs.
#
# A file that carries commons-configuration's `include` directive is refused in
# every mode, with exit status 2: the directive splices another file into this
# one, so "this key is absent" is a question that cannot be answered from this
# file alone, and writing into it could bury the definition the server reads.
# Rewrites stage through two exclusively created 0600 files (`mktemp`) rather
# than a predictable `<file>.tmp` / `<file>.bak`, which a writer in a mounted
# conf directory could have arranged as a symlink before the entrypoint, running
# as root, opened either of them.
